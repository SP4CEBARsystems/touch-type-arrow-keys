# Touch Type Arrow Keys
Emulates the arrow keys and other common keys from the touch-typing pose. It allows you to use the arrow keys without looking at the keyboard or moving your hands. It can help you make notes and code faster. It is made in [AutoHotKey V1](https://www.autohotkey.com/). 

## Installation
I have provided an [executable](https://github.com/SP4CEBARsystems/touch-type-arrow-keys/blob/main/touch%20type%20arrow%20keys.exe) for this macro that you can download and run if you trust me. I have to note that most AHK macros are flagged as trojans by some security vendors on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com), [here is the VirusTotal report for this executable](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/15da78467075e96f45bbf3a8cd0a1e8364f1f74af8ae6c276dfccf6e5257cf0f). If you don't trust me, [review the code](https://github.com/SP4CEBARsystems/touch-type-arrow-keys/blob/main/touch%20type%20arrow%20keys.ahk), [download AutoHotKey V1](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe), and [compile your own executable](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/Scripts.htm#ahk2exe-run). If you don't trust AutoHotKey check out [this report](https://safeweb.norton.com/report/show?url=autohotkey.com%2Fdownload).
